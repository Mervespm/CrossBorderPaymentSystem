# Running the test network

You can use the `./network.sh` script to stand up the Croos Border Payment System (CBPS) Network. (This network was created using the FAbric test network. For more information about fabric network, see [Using the Fabric test network](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html). The test network is being introduced in Fabric v2.0 as the long term replacement for the `first-network` sample.) The Croos Border Payment System Network has two peer organizations with one peer each and a single node raft ordering service. You can also use the `./network.sh` script to create more than one channel and deploy chaincode. 

Before you can deploy the CBPS network, you need to follow the instructions to [Install the Samples, Binaries and Docker Images](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the Hyperledger Fabric documentation.

## Using the Peer commands

First, ensure that the peer binaries are on your path, and the Fabric Config path is set assuming that you're in the `cbps-network` directory.

```bash
 export PATH=$PATH:$(realpath bin)
 export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$(realpath ../config)
```

The `setOrgEnv.sh` script can be used to set up the environment variables for the organizations, this will help to be able to use the `peer` commands directly. You can then set up the environment variables for each organization. The `./setOrgEnv.sh` command is designed to be run as follows.

```bash
export $(./setOrgEnv.sh Org2 | xargs)
```

(Note bash v4 is required for the scripts.)

You will now be able to run the `peer` commands in the context of Org2. If a different command prompt, you can run the same command with Org1 instead.
The `setOrgEnv` script outputs a series of `<name>=<value>` strings. These can then be fed into the export command for your current shell.

## Chaincode-as-a-service

To learn more about how to use the improvements to the Chaincode-as-a-service please see this [tutorial](.//cbps-network../CHAINCODE_AS_A_SERVICE_TUTORIAL.md). It is expected that this will move to augment the tutorial in the [Hyperledger Fabric ReadTheDocs](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.4/cc_service.html)


## Podman

*Note - podman support should be considered experimental but the following has been reported to work with podman 4.1.1 on Mac. If you wish to use podman a LinuxVM is recommended.*

Fabric's `install-fabric.sh` script has been enhanced to support using `podman` to pull down images and tag them rather than docker. The images are the same, just pulled differently. Simply specify the 'podman' argument when running the `install-fabric.sh` script. 

Similarly, the `network.sh` script has been enhanced so that it can use `podman` and `podman-compose` instead of docker. Just set the environment variable `CONTAINER_CLI` to `podman` before running the `network.sh` script:

```bash
CONTAINER_CLI=podman ./network.sh up
````

As there is no Docker-Daemon when using podman, only the `./network.sh deployCCAAS` command will work. Following the Chaincode-as-a-service Tutorial above should work.
